**Unofficial Evernote Cloud API for Qt**

![master](https://github.com/d1vanov/QEverCloud/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)

## What's this

This library presents the complete Evernote SDK for Qt.
All the functionality that is described on [Evernote site](http://dev.evernote.com/doc/)
is implemented and ready to use. In particular OAuth authentication is implemented.

Read doxygen generated [documentation](http://d1vanov.github.io/QEverCloud) for detailed info.

The documentation can also be generated in the form of a .qch file which you can register with
your copy of Qt Creator to have context-sensitive help. See below for more details.

## How to build

QEverCloud uses CMake build system which can be used as simply as follows (on Unix platforms):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<...> ../
make
make install
```

The library can be built and shipped either as a static library or a shared library. Dll export/import symbols necessary for Windows platform are supported.

QEverCloud uses C++17 standard. CMake automatically checks whether the compiler is capable enough of building QEverCloud so if the pre-build configuration step was successful, the build step should be successful as well. Known capable compilers are g++ 9 or later and Visual Studio 2019 or later.

The recommended version of Qt for building this NixNote-integrated library is Qt 6.

QEverCloud depends on the following Qt components:
 * Qt6Core
 * Qt6Widgets
 * Qt6Network
 * (Optional) Qt6WebEngineCore and Qt6WebEngineWidgets

The dependency on Qt6WebEngine is only required if the library is built with OAuth support and the QtWebEngine OAuth backend is selected. There is also an option to build OAuth support without QtWebEngine by delegating part of the OAuth procedure to the system browser.

By default the library is built with OAuth support and uses the system browser backend. The following cmake parameters are available to alter this behaviour:
 * `-DBUILD_WITH_OAUTH_SUPPORT=NO` would disable building with OAuth support entirely.
 * `-DQEVERCLOUD_USE_QT_WEB_ENGINE=ON -DQEVERCLOUD_USE_SYSTEM_BROWSER=OFF` would build the library with OAuth using Qt6WebEngine.
 * `-DQEVERCLOUD_USE_SYSTEM_BROWSER=ON` would build the library with OAuth without using Qt6WebEngine and instead delegate part of the OAuth procedure to the system browser.

If Qt6Test is found during the pre-build configuration step, the unit tests are enabled and can be run with `make test` and more verbose `make check` commands.

Other available CMake configurations options:

*BUILD_DOCUMENTATION* - when *ON*, attempts to find Doxygen and in case of success adds *doc* target so the documentation can be built using `make doc` command after the pre-build configuration step. By default this option is on.

*BUILD_QCH_DOCUMENTATION* - when *ON*, passes instructions on to Doxygen to build the documentation in *qch* format. This option only has any meaning if *BUILD_DOCUMENTATION* option is on. By default this option is off.

*BUILD_SHARED* - when *ON*, CMake configures the build for the shared library. By default this option is on.

*BUILD_WITH_Q_NAMESPACE* - when *ON*, `Q_NAMESPACE` and `Q_ENUM_NS` macros are used to add introspection capabilities to enumerations within `qevercloud` namespace. Qt >= 5.8 is required to enable this option. By default this option is enabled.

*BUILD_TRANSLATIONS* - when *ON*, builds and installs translation files for translatable strings from QEverCloud.

If *BUILD_SHARED* is *ON*, `make install` installs CMake module necessary for applications using CMake's `find_package` command to find the installation of QEverCloud.

It is possible to build the library with enabled sanitizers using additional CMake options:
 * `-DSANITIZE_ADDRESS=ON` to enable address sanitizer
 * `-DSANITIZE_MEMORY=ON` to enable memory sanitizer
 * `-DSANITIZE_THREAD=ON` to enable thread sanitizer
 * `-DSANITIZE_UNDEFINED=ON` to enable undefined behaviour sanitizer

## Include files for applications using the library

Two "cumulative" headers - *QEverCloud.h* or *QEverCloudOAuth.h* - include everything needed for the general and OAuth functionality correspondingly. More "fine-grained" headers can also be used if needed.

## Seeding random numbers generator for Qt < 5.10

QEverCloud requires random numbers generator for OAuth procedure. When QEverCloud is built against Qt >= 5.10, it uses `QRandomGenerator` which is cryptographically secure on supported platforms and is seeded by Qt internals. With Qt < 5.10 QEverCloud uses `qrand`. It requires the client application to call `qsrand` with seed value before using OAuth calls of QEverCloud. So if you are using QEverCloud built with Qt < 5.10, make sure to call `qsrand` before using QEverCloud's OAuth.
