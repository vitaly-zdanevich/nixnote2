     for new notes is the "current" time when the user indicated that
     the note is a reminder.  Clients may implement a separate
     "sort by date" feature to show notes ordered by reminderTime.

/**

 * service.  An instance consists of a type and a value, where the
 * value will be stored in one of the value fields depending upon the
 * data type required for the identity type.
 *
 * When used with shared notebook invitations, a UserIdentity
 * identifies a particular person who may not (yet) have an Evernote
 * UserID UserIdentity but who has (almost) unique access to the
 * service endpoint described by the UserIdentity.  For example, an
 * e-mail UserIdentity can identify the person who receives e-mail at
 * the given address, and who can therefore read the share key that
 * has a cryptographic signature from the Evernote service. With the
 * share key, this person can supply their Evernote UserID via an
 * authentication token to join the notebook
 * (authenticateToSharedNotebook), at which time we have associated
 * the e-mail UserIdentity with an Evernote UserID UserIdentity. Note
 * that using shared notebook records, the relationship between
 * Evernote UserIDs and e-mail addresses is many to many.
 *
 * Note that the identifier may not directly identify a
 * particular Evernote UserID UserIdentity without further
 * verification.  For example, an e-mail UserIdentity may be
 * associated with an invitation to join a notebook (via a shared
 * notebook record), but until a user uses a share key, that was sent

         In this situation, the client should replace any cached notes with the newly
